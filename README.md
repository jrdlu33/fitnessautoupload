# Cronometer to Google Sheets Automation

This script extracts nutrition data from **Cronometer** and automatically updates a **Google Sheet** with the latest information.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPO_FOLDER>
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have **Python 3.** installed, then install the required packages:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Google Sheets API  
You need to create a **Google Service Account** to allow the script to update your Google Sheets.  

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project.  
2. Enable the **Google Sheets API** for the project.  
3. Navigate to **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts** and create a new Service Account.  
4. Under **Keys**, generate a JSON key and download it into your **GitHub repo folder**.  
5. Share the **Google Service Account email** (found in the key file) with the Google Sheet you want to update (Editor access).  

### 4️⃣ Set Your Cronometer Credentials  
Open the script and replace:  
- `email_address` (Line **24**) → **Your Cronometer email**  
- `password` (Line **25**) → **Your Cronometer password**  

### 5️⃣ Set Google Sheet Details  
Modify these lines in the script:  
- `SPREADSHEET_ID` (Line **144**) → **Your Google Sheet ID**  
- `RANGE_NAME` (Line **145**) → **The sheet name & starting cell (e.g., `'Sheet1!A1'`)**  

### 6️⃣ Run the Script 🚀  
Once everything is set up, execute:  
```bash
python <your_script_name>.py
```
Your Google Sheet will be updated automatically with the latest Cronometer data! ✅

## 🔥 Troubleshooting  
- **Authentication issues?** Ensure your **Google Service Account email** has been added as an editor to the Google Sheet.  
- **Data not updating?** Check that `SPREADSHEET_ID` and `RANGE_NAME` match your Google Sheet settings.  
- **Dependencies missing?** Try re-running:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
